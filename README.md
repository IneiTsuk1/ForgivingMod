## Overview

**ForgivingMod** is a Minecraft mod designed to give players a more forgiving death system. Players have a limited number of lives, can earn bonus lives, and gain extra health with each respawn. Upon reaching their last life, players receive a special warning. Optionally, players who exceed their maximum lives can be banned automatically.

This mod is fully configurable via a JSON configuration file and supports per-player death tracking with optional bonus lives.
